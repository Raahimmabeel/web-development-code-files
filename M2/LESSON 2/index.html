are the eukaryotes that comprise the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic. This means that they
obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars
from carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the
genes for chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants are
multicellular, except for some green algae.

Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and
included algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since then; current definitions exclude fungi and some of the algae.
By the definition used in this article, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (green plants), which consists of the green
algae and the embryophytes or land plants (hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, conifers and other
gymnosperms, and flowering plants). A definition based on genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae
and the glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida.

There are about 380,000 known species of plants, of which the majority, some 260,000, produce seeds. They range in size
from single cells to the tallest trees. Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen;
the sugars they create supply the energy for most of Earth's ecosystems, and other organisms, including animals, either
eat plants directly or rely on organisms which do so.

Grain, fruit, and vegetables are basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. People use plants for many
purposes, such as building materials, ornaments, writing materials, and, in great variety, for medicines. The scientific
study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology.

Definition
Taxonomic history
Further information: Kingdom (biology) § History
All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification dates from
Aristotle (384–322 BC), who distinguished different levels of beings in his biology,[5] based on whether living things
had a "sensitive soul" or like plants only a "vegetative soul".[6] Theophrastus, Aristotle's student, continued his work
in plant taxonomy and classification.[7] Much later, Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of the modern system of
scientific classification, but retained the animal and plant kingdoms, naming the plant kingdom the Vegetabilia.[7]


Alternative concepts
When the name Plantae or plant is applied to a specific group of organisms or taxa, it usually refers to one of four
concepts. From least to most inclusive, these four groupings are:

Name(s) Scope Organisation Description
Land plants, also known as Embryophyta Plantae sensu strictissimo Multicellular Plants in the strictest sense include
liverworts, hornworts, mosses, and vascular plants, as well as fossil plants similar to these surviving groups (e.g.,
Metaphyta Whittaker, 1969,[8] Plantae Margulis, 1971[9]).
Green plants, also known as Viridiplantae, Viridiphyta, Chlorobionta or Chloroplastida Plantae sensu stricto Some
unicellular, some multicellular Plants in a strict sense include the green algae, and land plants that emerged within
them, including stoneworts. The relationships between plant groups are still being worked out, and the names given to
them vary considerably. The clade Viridiplantae encompasses a group of organisms that have cellulose in their cell
walls, possess chlorophylls a and b and have plastids bound by only two membranes that are capable of photosynthesis and
of storing starch. This clade is the main subject of this article (e.g., Plantae Copeland, 1956[10]).
Archaeplastida, also known as Plastida or Primoplantae Plantae sensu lato Some unicellular, some multicellular Plants in
a broad sense comprise the green plants listed above plus the red algae (Rhodophyta) and the glaucophyte algae
(Glaucophyta) that store Floridean starch outside the plastids, in the cytoplasm. This clade includes all of the
organisms that eons ago acquired their primary chloroplasts directly by engulfing cyanobacteria (e.g., Plantae
Cavalier-Smith, 1981[1]).
Old definitions of plant (obsolete) Plantae sensu amplo Some unicellular, some multicellular Plants in the widest sense
included the unrelated groups of algae, fungi and bacteria on older, obsolete classifications (e.g. Plantae or
Vegetabilia Linnaeus 1751,[11] Plantae Haeckel 1866,[12] Metaphyta Haeckel, 1894,[13] Plantae Whittaker, 1969[8]).
Evolution
Diversity

The desmid Cosmarium botrytis is a single cell.

The coast redwood Sequoia sempervirens is up to 120 metres (380 ft) tall.
There are about 382,000 accepted species of plants,[14] of which the great majority, some 283,000, produce seeds.[15]
The table below shows some species count estimates of different green plant (Viridiplantae) divisions. About 85–90% of
all plants are flowering plants.[clarification needed] Several projects are currently attempting to collect records on
all plant taxa in online databases, e.g. the World Flora Online.[14][16]

Plants range in scale from single-celled organisms such as desmids (from 10 micrometres (μm) across) and picozoa (less
than 3 μm across),[17][18] to the largest trees (megaflora) such as the conifer Sequoia sempervirens (up to 120 metres
(380 ft) tall) and the angiosperm Eucalyptus regnans (up to 100 m (325 ft) tall).[19]

The naming of plants is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants[31] and the
International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants.[32]
