<p>A computer is an electronic device that takes data (input), processes it using stored instructions (software) and
hardware, then produces meaningful results (information) as output, storing it for later use, operating on a binary
system (0s and 1s) to perform tasks from simple calculations to complex functions like running websites, games, and
managing business data</p>

<p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
(computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs, which
enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer
that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or
to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

<p>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems, including simple special-purpose
devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. Computers are at the core
of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the
Internet, which links billions of computers and users.</p>

<p>Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people
in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to
automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized
analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during
World War II, both electromechanical and using thermionic valves. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s
were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the
late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s.</p>
<br>
<p id="p5">Sticky</p>
<br>
<p>The speed, power, and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts
increasing at a rapid pace (Moore's law noted that counts doubled every two years), leading to the Digital Revolution
during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU)
in the form of a microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips. The
processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order
of operations in response to stored information.</p>
